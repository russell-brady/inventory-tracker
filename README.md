#Inventory Tracker

This is a small personal project I worked on to keep track of items in an inventory. 

It is a web application built using python flask which implements a sqllite database to keep track of items which have been taken from an inventory.

The application uses bootstrap and rendered templates. 

There is an automatic email system linked with the system and it can be configured to work with Slack.
